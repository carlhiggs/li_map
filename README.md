*This is a historical repository for a proof of concept javascript web app designed to facilitate visualisation and exploration of the spatial distribution of the Urban Liveability Index and its component indicators, calculated initially for address points in Melbourne in 2012.*

*I extended the prototype interactive map  with Gus Macaulay of Thuser to form the basis of the RMIT Australian Urban Observatory, subsequently launched in 2020.*

## Getting this thing to run ...

nodeenv .env
. .env/bin/activate
npm install
npm start

Should now be running localhost:3000
